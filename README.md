    Convolutional neural networks can be said to be the most popular network framework in the field of deep learning, especially in the field of computer vision. CNN started from LeNet in the 1990s and was quiet for 10 years in the early 21st century. Until 12 years, AlexNet began to renew its second spring. From zfNet to VGG, GoogLeNet to ResNet, DenseNet, etc., more and more excellent network architectures are coming out. Convolutional neural networks from object classification, object recognition, segmentation, instance segmentation to real-time segmentation of 3D objects, neural network recognition accuracy and speed have made great progress, applications are more and more extensive, and will gradually and our lives More closely. As a fan and practitioner of deep learning, summarize and analyze CNN's various classic architectures, and share with you the beauty of the smart collision between the great gods in CNN's development process.
